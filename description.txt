The Bucket Of Bolts mod simply adds an item which will summon every mech boss master mode pet, crafted with each of them!

It also adds a small probe to go alongside the destroyer if its summoned. The mod is intended to be played with the Calamity Texture Pack, although it's not necessary

As with all code by me, this mod is 100% free and open source, this means you can modify and redistribute to your heart's content. 
*However* please credit me for the original code and sprites. It'd also be appreciated if you told me about it!
